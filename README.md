# This Is Not A Real Branch
*What you see in this branch is actually pieces of code produced when I was learning certain subjects. I think it meaningful to have a place on the cloud to store some of my code for future reference or just as memories of the learning journey. A good programmer was once a clumsy one. You will probably see in this branch some bad code which should never be used in real projects. Although I do not think I am now a good programmer, I keep trying and working to become better. If you are pleased to offer me some help or suggestions, please email me at 1729403632@qq.com. I would much appreciate you for your kindness.*
