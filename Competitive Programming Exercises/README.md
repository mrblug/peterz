# Something to Say
&nbsp;&nbsp; After dropping learning competitive programming, I've never thought about learning algorithms systematically. It was about a year ago, I failed in one programming competition, which hit me a lot. I asked myself if I was suitable for competitive programming. I had no answer but I did know that I would have no choice if I finally failed in programming competitions. The risk of failure was so high, as I thought, that I should not give up my study and dedicate most of my time and energy to competitive programming.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; However, learning algorithms is not just for competitive programming. I may give up competitive programming, but I should not stop learning algorithms. This repository is named 'competitive programming exercises' simply because the problems and code in it are from books or online-judges related to competitive programming. Although I'm not a professional programming competitor, I will try my best to make this repository more like professional.
