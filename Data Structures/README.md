This directory contains code for **Data Structures**, a course I am taking this semester.  
I will pick the best parts of my work.  
The problem description will be given, so you need not worry about not getting original problems.  

***However, malloc() and free() are not always paired in the code. That is to say, you may have to define your own clearing functions.***   

Anyway, my code is **not always** the best solution. If you have any better ideas, do what I said in the 'branch'.  
Thank you! :-)
