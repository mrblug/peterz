This directory contains code for **Data Structures**, a course I am taking this semester.  
I will pick the best parts of my work.  
The problem description will be given, so you need not worry about not getting original problems.  
Anyway, my code is **not always** the best solution. If you have any better ideas, do what I said in the 'branch'.  
Thank you! :-)
